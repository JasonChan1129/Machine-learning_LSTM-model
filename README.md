# Long short-term memory (LSTM) machine learning model
## What is this project about 
* Using LSTM model to predict the long-term settlement of Kansai International Airport, as well as the test embankment of Chek Lap Kok Hong Kong International Airport.
* A Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the developed LSTM model was built for facilitating application in engineering practice.

## How to run the file
`Datebase`
> This folder contains the database of the settlement of Kansai International Airport and Kok Hong Kong International Airport.  

`Main code`
> This folder contains the code for building the model. HKA_settlement_measure.py is for HKIA, Settlement_airport(measured value_ave.).py is for KIA.

`LSTM model`
> This folder contains the trained LSTM model based on the KIA database. The .h5 file can be directly imported for model testing.  

`GUI`. 

> This folder contains the code for the GUI, run the make_model_edit.py file to use the GUI.

## Download the required python packages
> run `pip install (the package name)` for every required packages listed in code.
